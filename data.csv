a application and process monitoring in real time designer process and task design guideline process and task design guideline it be important that you follow the guideline below when design process and task to be monitor by default task must be mutually exclusive ,0
therefore make sure that the trigger or logical procedure that these task represent be also mutually exclusive in real life ,0
in some case there may be a logical order for execute task ,0
in such situation you may want to link the start of one task to the end of another task ,0
this mean that the end of the first task act as the trigger for the start of the second task ,0
in other case where you can not be sure of the order of performance of task you need to define standalone trigger  verify that task have start and stop trigger that correctly reflect what you be try to measure ,0

define the property of the process solution guide nice advanced process automation ,0
desktop analytic ,0
a application and process monitoring in real time designer configure an automatic process a define the queue tag value ,0
the queue tag provide a means to categorize the process ,0
for example because handle email be a generic activity you may want to categorize the email be handle by type such as claim relate email request relate email and so on ,0
in a wfm environment different type of email be automatically handle separately ,0
in order to provide information to the wfm system in the most usable form you also want to categorize email by type so that email handle time for different email type can be count separately ,0
use queue tag can help differentiate between the various context of the usage of a process ,0
note for automatic process a queue tag must have or few character and must not include space or tab ,0
this limitation be require when send process information to workforce management wfm ,0
if the process information be not be send to wfm and you require more than character in the queue tag use a text business entity in the queue tag instead of a static value ,0
the business entity and its initial value can include more than character ,0
for our scenario select business entity message orientation in the drop down list ,0
the message orientation value mean that the email type can be determine directly from the email itself ,0
in effect this selection extract the prefix of the email address in the to field of an email up to the sign in the address ,0
the extract prefix be then use to tag categorize email by type so that email handle time for different email type can be count separately ,0

a application and process monitoring in real time designer configure an automatic process b define the unique i d value ,0
the unique i d identify the process instance currently be execute ,0
this field be use to support multiple instance of a process in a seamless manner ,0
the unique i d be assign once when the process start ,0
the unique i d typically have some type of business meaning and be use to uniquely identify a specific transaction problem or issue be handle ,0
note real time designer s screen integration and connectivity technology can connect to multiple instance of a window or application at any give point in time ,0
however for the purpose of this exercise we assume that only the active instance of an email message window be consider ,0
the unique i d be limit to character ,0
if it be long than that the value be truncate by the server ,0
if preferred use the alternative unique i d property to temporarily store a business unique i d while the process use an operational unique i d  at run time the value you specify for this property be assign to the unique i d of the process when the process stop ,0
important the unique i d enable you to handle various type of circumstance describe below ,0
the uniqueness of the value be crucial for a process ,0
for our scenario the email caption subject be use to determine the unique i d  to do so select current message caption in the drop down list ,0
solution guide nice advanced process automation ,0
desktop analytic ,0
a application and process monitoring in real time designer configure an automatic process this selection mean that the unique i d be take from the subject line show in the message window caption of the email message window currently in focus even when multiple email message window be open simultaneously ,0
for example let s say that you first open email a that contain the subject aaa,0
and then you open email b which contain the subject bbb ,0
you now have two instance of the same process where one be assign to a message window with subject aaa and the other to a message window with the subject bbb ,0
real time designer process monitoring can differentiate between these two process instance and can count for each of they accordingly ,0
therefore when the user perform another action such as click the reply button in one of these email the reply action be automatically associate with the correct process instance base on the value of the business entity property current message caption at the time of the click event ,1
in the example describe above the unique i d associate a process instance with a physical entity in this case a message window ,0
you can also use the unique i d to associate handling time across multiple user or process ,1
for example you could use a claim I d as the unique i d for this purpose ,0
the unique i d enable you to handle both type of circumstance describe above ,1
it be important to specify the correct type of value in the desktop in order to ensure that it be in fact unique such as claim i d or claim i d day hour ,0
the uniqueness of the value be crucial for this purpose ,0
c define the timeout after value by check its checkbox and then assign a numeric value in the adjacent box ,0
the timeout define the process total time once reach the process will be terminate and be not dependent on the activity in the process time ,0
this field be optional and be useful if the standard stop trigger do not occur or be never reach ,0
note if this option be not check and there be no value assign to it the default timeout value will be accord to the real time designer setting second ,0
however if you assign a value in the automatic process it will override the timeout configure in the setting ,0
d define the idle after value by check its checkbox and then assign a numeric value in the adjacent box ,0
this field enable you to specify an idle threshold in second ,0
idle time be measure at the process level and indicate when no mouse or keyboard action be detect for long than the specified threshold ,0
in this case the value be second ,0
this field be optional and be useful when the idle threshold of the process should be different than the idle threshold of the desktop ,0

the process resume when the next input event be receive keyboard or mouse ,0
note a lock state indicate that the user s desktop be lock  ,1
define the action when process end use the action editor in the middle of the window ,0
use the action editor to define the instruction to be perform when the process end ,0
for example to start a workflow once the process end ,0
this action editor work in the same manner as other action editor available in real time designer  ,0
specify the link data collection activity value ,0
note when you select datum collection in the process propertie the activate and collect function be trigger behind the scene when the process s stop trigger be trigger  ,0

when you select this option you must define the trigger condition or event for pause and resume  ,0
remember to define a resume trigger for the task you will need to define a resume trigger even if there be no define pause trigger in other word even if the pause checkbox be not select  note if for the same process type there be more than one instance run because both instance receive their unique i d value from the same data source define in the process type when the unique i d value change the process pause and resume automatically accord to the unique i d value and the instance it match ,1
the resume trigger be take into consideration if it occur however when a trigger be fire for any process trigger that be define in the process type it look at the current unique i d value to ensure that it be apply to the correct process instance ,0
the resume trigger will have no effect if it be fire from a process that be already run since the unique i d have probably not change and it will try to resume the same instance that be already run ,0
the resume trigger be mandatory even if there be no pause trigger define in case where a process type be pause but be not automatically resume ,0

a d desktop analytic good practice mapping display name and category mapping display name and category the first step towards manage your site be to map exist and frequently use application and web page to display name and to category ,0
this procedure be break down into a few step in the following procedure ,0
remember to use the tip see tip when mapping display name and category on page  to map application and web page to display name and category ,0
create a list of your application and web page with which your agent work and also interact ,0
do this by select one of the follow method manually by create two list frequently use application and web page  frequently use website ,0
automate by use the import display name option in the real time designer ,0
see import select application page name into display name table on page for detail  consideration use the manual method you can prepare the list ahead of time and have a completely clean database where all major application be define ahead of time ,0
the automate option require day of monitor a small group of agent ,0
although this method create unmapped datum that will stay unmapped even after display name mapping it will allow future application to be map in a more automated and client activity relate manner ,0
unmappe datum be not an issue due to the follow there be a relatively small amount of dirty datum which will diminish with time raw datum will always exist in the database due the fact that client activity be not deterministic  ,0
define the business goal ,0
in order to define business category you must define the business goal business direction of the category  make sure this be plan wisely as you should only define one category per display name ,0
example follow be example of business direction to find bottle neck in productivity ,1
to see how agent spend their time at work ,0

a d desktop analytic good practice mapping display name and category ,0
create category ,0
this be an important point in the solution as category be mean to reflect the ultimate business goal your company expect to achieve when use the desktop analytic solution ,0
category can be broad or narrow base on the business need ,0
category name must be short as later on they appear in the report ,0
example if you define your business goal as find bottle neck in productivity then you might use the follow category productive in other word productive to the business process  business relate in other word non productive but business relate  unproductive non productive to the business process ,1
if you define your business goal as see how agent spend their time at work then you might use the follow category business application ,0
administrative tool  social network ,0
import and map the application and web page to display name ,0
you can use the import display name option in the real time designer ,0

change display name on page ,0
use display name to control final report by use display name wisely you will greatly increase the report performance and meaningfulness and will consequently create a more refined focus of the datum display in the final report  use display name to group application and web page ,0
example you want to know the amount of time agent spend on office application ,0
what do you do you must group similar application and web page to the same display name  use wildcard to reflect the low level of information you want to see in your report ,0
example you want to know how agent time be split between flight and hotel research ,1
what do you do you must add a wildcard in the application web page name at the low level you be willing to see in the report ,0

this change will be reflect in the report for past datum as well ,0
but if the application or web page be not map past datum will remain uncategorized ,0
when you first map a display name or category this do not map the display name or category in the datum from that time backwards ,0

you can far customize the sorting to provide custom definition for the folder into which the issue be sort ,0
you can provide definition for any number of folder whose content be then define by filter ,0
filter can either alter the visibility of an issue or place it into a folder ,0
when use to sort issue into folder you define the nature of the issue that appear in the customize folder ,0
you group filter into filter set and then use the filter set to sort and filter the issue display ,0
an issue template can contain definition for multiple filter set ,0
use multiple filter set in an audit project enable you to quickly change the sorting and visibility of the issue you be audit ,0
for example the default issue template use in the interface provide two filter set ,0
these filter set provide an increasingly restrictive view of security relate issue ,0
define multiple filter set for an audit project enable different user different view and a customize view do not affect any other view ,1
in addition to provide sort and filtering mechanism you can also customize the auditing process by define custom tag in the issue template ,0
auditor associate custom tag with issue during auditing ,0
for example custom tag can be use to track impact severity or priority of an issue use the same name and value use to track these attribute in other system such as a bug tracker application ,0

hpe security fortify audit workbench  page of appendix b static analysis result prioritization the follow topic describe how fortify static code analyzer automatically prioritize the scan result display in audit workbench ,0
this section contain the follow topic about result prioritization quantify risk estimate impact and likelihood with input from rule and analysis about result prioritization fortify static code analyzer divide static analysis finding into four risk quadrant critical high medium and low ,0
membership in each quadrant depend on whether the finding have a high or low impact and high or low likelihood of occur ,0
when fortify static code analyzer produce a result file automate processing and human review can convert issue into finding ,0
finding which represent specific problem with the codebase sometimes map one to one with issue ,0
however in other case multiple related issue might be combine into a single finding ,0
for example every form that submit a request without include a unique token might produce an issue relate to cross site request forgery csrf but these issue be more useful when they be combine into a single finding that indicate the application as a whole be vulnerable to csrf attack ,0
hpe security fortify audit workbench  page of user guide appendix b static analysis result prioritization on occasion the static analysis process go wrong ,1
depend on the rule and the analysis algorithm use a static analysis can produce false positive report vulnerability where no vulnerability exist or false negative unreported vulnerability or both ,1
quantify risk because it be not possible to determine if or when an organization will suffer consequence relate to a particular vulnerability fortify static code analyzer take a probabilistic approach to prioritize vulnerability ,0
risk be define quantitatively as follow risk impact x likelihood the risk that a vulnerability pose be equal to the impact of the vulnerability multiply by the likelihood that the impact will occur ,0
impact be define as the negative outcome result from a vulnerability and likelihood as the probability that the impact will happen ,0
impact can come in many form ,0
for example an organization might lose money or reputation because of a successful attack or it might lose business opportunity because the presence of a vulnerability cause a system to fail a regulatory compliance check ,0
two factor contribute to the likelihood that a particular vulnerability will cause harm l the probability that the vulnerability will be discover by an attacker or an auditor l the conditional probability that once find the vulnerability will be exploit these probability change as the computer security field advance ,0
new vulnerability assessment technique make it easy to find vulnerability and new attack technique increase the set of vulnerability that can be exploit ,0
progressively well vulnerability prevention mitigation and recovery strategy help counterbalance these advance ,1
for example consider race condition singleton member field vulnerability which occur when code assign a value associate with a particular user session to a member variable of a singleton object in a web application ,1
since under the singleton model the same class instance be use to service all request value from one user session can spill over into another user s session ,1
the follow code demonstrate a singleton member field race condition public class guestbook extend httpservlet string name password protect void dopost httpservletrequest request httpservletresponse response name requestgetparameter username password requestgetparameter password if dbutilslookupuser username password accesssensitiveresource hpe security fortify audit workbench ,1
page of user guide appendix b static analysis result prioritization although this vulnerability be fairly simple to exploit after it be find find race condition can be difficult because successful attack often depend on very precise timing ,1
therefore this class of vulnerability have a low likelihood of occur which primarily reflect the difficulty involve in find the vulnerability ,0
for an example of a vulnerability whose likelihood be primarily govern by how difficult it be to exploit consider http header manipulation which occur when unvalidated user input be include in an http response header and can enable cross site scripting http response splitting and cache poisoning among other attack ,1
the follow code demonstrate a header manipulation vulnerability string author requestgetparameter author param cookie cookie new cookie author author cookiesetmaxage cookieexpiration responseaddcookie cookie in this case identify a vulnerable application be often quite simple because the vulnerability be evident in web traffic return from the server ,0
craft a meaningful exploit however typically involve a deep understanding of the application s business logic ready access to a pool of legitimate user and in some case a work knowledge of the network topography between the server and the user ,1
therefore this class of vulnerability have a low likelihood because it be difficult to exploit ,0
estimate impact and likelihood with input from rule and analysis fortify static code analyzer estimate the impact of a discover vulnerability base on its type ,0
the impact value be associate with the static analysis rule that define the vulnerability ,0
in this way result can indicate that a category such as cross site scripting have a high impact than a category such as null pointer dereference ,0
to compute the likelihood portion of the risk equation fortify static code analyzer draw on value from the rule use for analysis the analysis process itself and from a human auditor if an individual have review the result ,0
the likelihood of a finding be compute by combine the accuracy of the rule and the confidence in the analysis with the probability that the vulnerability will be discover and act upon as follow likelihood accuracy x confidence x probability for the purpose of weigh static analysis result an accuracy measure be associate with each rule apply by the analysis engine ,0
this number represent the possibility that the rule will correctly identify a vulnerability ,0
for example the rule that fortify static code analyzer use to identify the member field race condition have a high accuracy because it precisely identify assignment to a member field of a singleton object ,0
conversely the rule use to identify cross site request forgery have a low accuracy because it identify potentially vulnerable form submission and rely on a human auditor to determine whether the form submission be susceptible to cross site request forgery ,0
hpe security fortify audit workbench  page of user guide appendix b static analysis result prioritization during static analysis fortify static code analyzer might have to make assumption about the way the code behave at runtime ,1
the more assumption fortify static code analyzer make the more likely it be that a result be incorrect ,0
the term confidence be use to estimate the possibility that fortify static code analyzer correctly apply the rule ,0
for example fortify static code analyzer report reflect cross site scripting vulnerability in a jsp where datum from a request parameter be echo directly to the page with high confidence ,0
conversely fortify static code analyzer report a persistent cross site scripting issue where datum read from a database into a class select at runtime use dependency injection be render in the presentation tier with low confidence ,0
to represent the probability that the vulnerability be discover and act upon with action potentially come the form of an exploit fortify static code analyzer associate a probability measure with each category of vulnerability identify by the rule ,0
for example cross site scripting vulnerability carry a high probability than member field race condition because they be more likely to be discover and exploit ,0
from a programmer s perspective some bug be hard to fix than other ,0
modify a single line of code in a self contain method be easy than modify the result of a sequence of call that span the program ,0
the term remediation effort describe the relative amount of effort require to fix and verify a finding ,0
fortify static code analyzer provide a remediation effort with each finding it report ,0
for example member field race condition have a small remediation effort while cross site request forgery which often involve major change to a website have a high remediation effort ,0
to avoid imply too much precision where little exist fortify static code analyzer limit value of impact accuracy confidence and probability to a decimal range of from ,0
and scale the calculate likelihood value to the same range ,0
it then define high value for impact and likelihood as those at ,0
and above  ,0
and low value as those below   ,0
fortify static code analyzer do not provide unit for remediation effort because the absolute cost of remediate different vulnerability differ from one organization to another ,0
instead remediation effort estimate the relative cost to remediate one kind of find versus another thereby enable a comparison of the effort require to remediate different vulnerability or vulnerability across more than one project ,0
the follow table provide sample impact accuracy confidence and probability value for the four vulnerability mention in this section along with the result risk calculation and correspond remediation effort for each vulnerability category ,0
category impact accuracy confidence probability risk race condition singleton member field cross site request forgery impact high likelihood risk critical estimate remediation effort impact low likelihood hpe security fortify audit workbench ,0

this chapter outline the methodology and consideration you need to take for successful deployment and use of sitescope ,0
note use the information below to assist you in your preparation before begin the installation ,0
for in depth deployment planning good practice consult your hp professional service representative ,0
have a consistent methodology be essential for effective system monitoring ,0
however it be not always obvious how to approach develop and deploy an enterprise monitoring solution ,0
the solution need to consider the role of the it infrastructure and how it contribute to the success of the organization ,0
system monitoring be a tool you use to ensure the availability and function of service use by the organization to meet its key objective ,0
you can use the following as a guide to plan your system monitoring ,0
what to monitor effective enterprise system management use a multi tiered monitoring approach ,0
sitescope give you the tool to implement this ,0
at one level you want to monitor individual hardware element in the infrastructure to see that they be run and available ,0
you want to add to this monitoring of key service and process on these system ,0
this include low level operating system process as well as process indicate the health and performance of key application ,0
on top of this you want to hp sitescope ,0
page of deployment guide chapter deployment methodology and planning create transactional monitoring of business process to see that key application and service be available and function as expect ,0
what threshold level represent an event the availability and performance of information system be critical to enterprise business success ,0
the threshold that you set for monitor be determine by the nature of the system or business process you be monitor ,0
how often the system should be check how often you have a system check can be as important as the event threshold you set ,0
the availability of mission critical information system should be check regularly during the period that there be to be accessible ,0
in many case system need to be available hour a day day a week ,0
you control how often sitescope check a system with the frequency set for each monitor ,0
too much time between check may delay detection of problem ,0
too frequent checking may load an already busy system unnecessarily ,0
what action to take when an event be detect as a monitoring application sitescope provide you with the tool to detect problem ,0
you use sitescope alert to send timely notification when an event threshold have be trigger ,0
an email notification be a commonly use alert action ,0
sitescope include other alert type that can integrate with other system ,0
you can develop an alert escalation scheme by define multiple alert definition with different alert trigger criterion ,0
you use the when setting for alert to customize the relation between detect event and alert action ,0
another event action may be to disable monitoring and alert for system that be dependent on a system that have become unavailable ,0
sitescope group and monitor dependency option can be use to avoid cascade series of alert ,0
what automate response can be perform when problem be detect an automate response to resolve the problem be ideal ,0
while this be not possible for all system the sitescope script alert type do provide a flexible and powerful tool for automate corrective action for a variety of situation ,0
you should consider what problem that may arise in your environment could be address with an automate response ,0
hp sitescope  page of deployment guide chapter deployment methodology and planning business system infrastructure assessment ,0

hp sitescope  page of deployment guide chapter deployment methodology and planning sitescope server size the foundation of successful monitoring deployment be proper sizing of the server where sitescope be to run ,0
server sizing be determine by a number of factor include l the number of monitor instance to be run on the sitescope installation ,0
l the average run frequency for the monitor ,0
l the type of protocol and application to be monitor ,0
l how much monitor datum need to be retain on the server for reporting ,0
know the number of server in the environment their respective operating system and the application to be monitor be the starting point for estimate the number of monitor that may be need ,0
see size sitescope on window platform on page or size sitescope on linux platform on page for a table of server size recommendation base on estimation of the number of monitor to be run ,0
network location and environment the majority of sitescope monitoring be perform by emulate web or network client that make request of server and application in the network environment ,0
for this reason sitescope must be able to access server system and application throughout the network ,0
this help determine where sitescope should be instal ,0
the method use by sitescope for monitor system server and application can be divide into two category l standard base network protocol ,0
this include http https smtp ftp and snmp ,0
l platform specific network service and command ,0
this include netbio telnet rlogin and secure shell ssh ,1
infrastructure monitoring rely on platform specific service ,0
as an agentless solution monitoring require that sitescope log on and authenticate frequently to many server in the infrastructure ,0
for performance and security reason it be good to deploy sitescope within the same domain and as close to the system element to be monitor as possible ,0
it be also good to have sitescope in the same hp sitescope ,0
page of deployment guide chapter deployment methodology and planning subnet as the applicable network authentication service for example active directory nis or ldap ,0
the sitescope interface can be access and manage remotely as need use http or https ,0
note try to avoid deploy sitescope in a location where a significant amount of the monitoring activity require communication across a wide area network wan ,0
tip for security reason it be recommend not to use sitescope to monitor server through a firewall because of the different protocol and port require for server availability monitoring ,0
sitescope licensing be not server base and support have separate sitescope installation for both side of a firewall ,1
two or more separate sitescope installation can be access simultaneously from a single workstation use http or https ,0
consideration for windows environment sitescope must be instal use an account with administrator privilege ,1
it be also recommend that the sitescope service be run with a user account that have administrator privilege ,1
a local system account can be use but this affect the configuration of connection profile to remote window server ,1
also sitescope use the window performance registry on remote machine to monitor server resource and availability ,0
to enable this monitoring capability the remote registry service for the remote machine must be activate ,0
consideration for linux environment sitescope must be instal on a linux environment by the root user ,1
after sitescope have be instal you can create a non root user account with permission to run sitescope unless the sitescope web server be run on a privileged port in which case it should be run by the root user ,1
for detail on configure a non root user with permission to run sitescope see configure a non root user account with permission to run sitescope on the next page ,1
the follow be additional information relate to the setup of agentless monitoring of remote unix server with sitescope l remote login account shell ,1
sitescope as an application can run successfully under most popular unix shell ,0
when sitescope communicate with a remote unix server it prefer hp sitescope  page of deployment guide chapter deployment methodology and planning communicating with either bourne shell sh or tsch shell ,0
the relevant login account on each remote unix server should therefore have its shell set to use one of these shell ,1
note set a shell profile only for the login account use by sitescope to communicate with the remote machine ,1
other application and account on the remote machine can use their currently define shell ,1
l account permission ,1
it may be necessary to resolve command permission setting for monitor remote unix server ,0
most of the command that sitescope run to get server information from a remote unix server be locate in the usr bin directory on the remote server ,0
some command however such as the command to get memory information be locate in usr sbin ,0
the difference between these two location be that usr sbin command be usually reserve for the root user or other highly privileged user ,1
note although sitescope require highly privileged account permission for security reason it be recommend not to run sitescope use the root account or to configure it to use root login account on remote server ,1
if you have problem with permission you need to either have sitescope log on as a different user that have permission to run the command or have the permission change for the user account that sitescope be use ,1
configure a non root user account with permission to run sitescope sitescope must be instal on linux from a root user account ,1
after sitescope have be instal you can create a non root user account with permission to run sitescope ,1
note while sitescope require highly privileged account permission to enable the full range of server monitoring it be recommend not to run sitescope from the root account and not to configure sitescope to use the root account to access remote server ,1
to create a non root user account with permission to use sitescope ,1
add a new user useradd newuser ,1
change permission for the sitescope installation folder chmod opt hp sitescope r hp sitescope ,0

as a system availability monitor tool sitescope might have access to system information that could be use to compromise system security if step be not take to secure it ,0
you should use the configuration and setup option in this section to protect the sitescope platform ,0
caution there be two web server that be active and serve two version of the sitescope product interface the sitescope web server and the apache tomcat server supply with sitescope ,0
to limit all access to sitescope you must apply the applicable setting to both of these server ,1
hp sitescope  page of deployment guide chapter harden the sitescope platform set sitescope user preference sitescope user profile be use to require a user name and password to access the sitescope interface ,1
after installation sitescope be normally accessible to any user who have http access to the server on which sitescope be run ,1
by default sitescope be instal with only one user account and this account do not have a default user name or password define for it ,1
this be the administrator account ,1
you should define a user name and password for this account after instal and access the product ,1
you can also create other user account profile to control how other user may access the product and what action they may perform ,1
for more information on create user account see the user management preference section in use sitescope in the sitescope help ,1
password encryption all sitescope password be encrypt use a method call triple datum encryption standard tde ,1
tde apply the datum encryption algorithm on each bit block of text three successive time use either two or three different key ,0
as a result it be extremely difficult for unauthorized user to reproduce the original password ,1
use transport layer security tls to access sitescope you can configure sitescope to use tls to control access to the product interface ,0
for more information see configure sitescope to communicate over a secure connection on page  note transport layer security tls be the new name for secure socket layer ssl ,0
the sitescope user interface still include reference to ssl ,1
the term be use interchangeably in sitescope ,0
smart card authentication smart card be physical device use to identify user in secure system ,1
these card can be use to store certificate which verify the user s identity and allow access to secure environment ,1
sitescope support user authentication use smart card ,1
if smart card authentication be configure you can not log in to sitescope without a valid smart card ,0
there be different type of smart card that can be use with sitescope which include hp sitescope ,0
page of deployment guide chapter harden the sitescope platform l cac ,0
the common access card often call cac card be a smart card that it be use by the us department of defense ,0
this smart card be require to do any work on government system in the military ,0
l piv ,0
like their military counterpart federal employee and contractor within civilian agency also need smart card ,0
they use a similar standard know as a piv card personal identification verification ,0
the card be slightly different from cac and have vary information print on they depend on the issue agency ,0
they use a different set of can certificate authority server than the one that cac use ,0
the piv card be personalize with datum need by the piv system to grant access to the subscriber to federal facility and information system assure appropriate level of security for all applicable federal application and provide interoperability among federal organization use the standard ,0
for detail on configure smart card authentication see configure smart card authentication on page ,0
note there be many different smart card vendor that exist in the market ,0
to support all the different permutation for use client certificate you can use the follow parameter in the sitescope root group masterconfig file l clientcertificateauthjitccomplianceenforcementenable l clientcertificateauthsmartcardenforcementenable l clientcertificateauthisgetuidfromsubject l clientcertificateauthallowlocalusers l clientcertificatesubjectalternativenamesgeneralname l clientcertificateauthenable joint interoperability test command jitc certification jitc be a united states military organization that test technology that pertain to multiple branch of the armed service and government ,1
