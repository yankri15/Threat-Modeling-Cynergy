Here's a high-level plan on how to proceed:

V Update the SentimentAnalysis.py script: need to update the script to read the new CSV file format that you created in the data preprocessing phase. Make sure that the script correctly loads the data and the labels (threat tags) for each sentence.

V Modify the DNN model: use the LSTM-based DNN model. need to ensure that the model is set up correctly for multi-label classification (since each sentence can have multiple threat tags). This might involve changing the loss function to binary cross-entropy and using a sigmoid activation function in the output layer.

V Train the DNN model: Once the model is set up, I can train it using the preprocessed data. split your data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.

V Evaluate the model: After training, evaluate the model's performance on a test set. I can use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each threat tag to get a detailed understanding of the model's performance.

Model Improvement: Based on the model's performance, I might need to tweak its parameters or structure. This could involve adding more layers to the model, changing the number of units in the LSTM layers, or using techniques like dropout for regularization.

Threat Prediction: Once i'm satisfied with the model's performance, I can use it to predict the threat tags of new sentences.
